# AWS Community Day 2025 Web Application

This repository contains the source code for the AWS Community Day 2025 event website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The application is designed for scalability, maintainability, and future internationalization.

## Project Overview

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font via `next/font`
- **Deployment:** Vercel (recommended)
- **Internationalization:** English and French translations planned (coming soon)

## Features

- Modern React architecture using Next.js
- Optimized font loading for performance and aesthetics
- Modular codebase for easy feature extension
- Ready for multi-language support (i18n)

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can begin development by editing `app/page.js`. Hot reloading is enabled for rapid iteration.

## Internationalization Roadmap

Support for English and French translations will be integrated using Next.js i18n routing and translation files. This will enhance accessibility and user experience for a broader audience.

## Engineering Practices

- **Version Control:** Git for source management
- **Code Quality:** Modular components, clear separation of concerns
- **Performance:** Font optimization, server-side rendering
- **Scalability:** Designed for future feature additions and localization
